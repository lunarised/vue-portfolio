          "<p> Most of my prototype programming is done in Java, as it was\
      the first language which I learnt to a degree of proficiency. The fact that it is\
      very clean for crossplatform development is ideal for me as a Windows x Linux \
      Based Programmer. In Java, I have explored many problems, from implementing data\
      structures and building GUI's to creating more complex applications with data-graphing,\
      and even doing some (now understandably) silly systems programming. Java is definitely one\
      of my go-to languages for any sort of software development or mock up</p>"

          "Python2 was the first programming language I tried that \
      wasn't connected to some kind of microcontroller. I didn't really enjoy python2 that much \
      until I tried out python3 and decided that it was the language I like to toy with. I have \
      experience in many areas of python3 development, such data-science and AI (using tools \
      such as tensor flow and numpy), designing and testing algoriths, OO Principles, and my \
      favorite of all, funtional programming. While python is almost never my first choice \
      as a language for a project, It's a language that I don't get tired of too quickly"
      },

      { name: "C++", 
      text: "C++ is the language where I first started building big projects. I build a \
      roguelike game in C++ for my Programming 4 paper. While most of the project was done \
      in the .NET framework, with little native C++ being written, I did write some C++ for \
      the more difficult parts of the project (such as using native vectors for the room \
      generation algorithm, which was utilizing a poisson distribution). I enjoy writing \
      C++, and It is probably one of my best languages, beside Java and Python" },

      { name: "C", text: "While Rust is my go to systems programming language, I got my \
      love of systems programming from using C. I have used C in many projects, from CLI \
      games of ECard, to several arduino projects (such as a digital theremin, or a \
      collision avoiding robot). I still get a kick out of firing up my C environment, and \
      re-figuring out memory management, which is a thrill I dont get in any of my other \
      programming languages of choice." },

      { name: "C#", text: "My experience with C# was originally as a way to manage windows \
      forms, and was taught as one of the first languages in my Bachelor of IT. While I \
      enjoyed programming in C# then, It wasn't until I played around with making some\
       functionally designed components for my software testing before I truly realised that \
       this language could do so much more than be an OO heavy weight like Java. While C# \
       is not my best language, Nor a language I will pick over another (Outside of Windows \
       forms), I feel I can both develop and review functions written in it " },

      { name: "Ruby", text: "My experience with Ruby has only been for 2 small projects. The \
      first one was for a programming assignment, where we had to create the famous Mastermind \
      game in Ruby. It was here where I first discovered how clean this language looks. From the \
      english like way that it read, to the sample method that retrieved a random element in a \
      list, this language had everything a beautiful language could have. The other project I \
      have used ruby to work through, was a bot that connected to a fediverse instance, and \
      made shitposts from a set of files pertaining to musicians/bands, and sentences. I still \
      haven't finished this project, but it is one i'm quite fond of" },

          "Rust is a language that I always strive to get better at. \
      Currently, it is nowhere near one of my most proficient languages, However, I am always \
      excited for whenever I get the time to go through and write/learn a little bit of rust. It \
      really is one of my passions in IT, and I hope to see rust grow into a popular language \
      in the coming years. The features I enjoy the most about rust are the Data Ownership Model \
      and the provable thread safety. The cargo dependancy manager is pretty cool too. \
      While I wouldn't be able to code myself out of a box with rust, I'd certainly have a fun \
      time while I am in there."

      { name: "Bash", text: "Bash has always been a funny language for me to program in. On \
      one hand, doing batch processing in it is very straight forward as you can consider it \
      a sequence of commands, although, once you add conditionals and loops, bash gets rather \
      ugly. I ended up writing a tool in bash that helps initialize jekyll pages. I made this \
      after one of my friends who blogs, asked me why he spent more time writing in metadata for \
      jekyll to process than he did writing his posts. So i essentially made a barebones bash \
      script that fills out the metadata for me. I will oneday put it in a build package, but \
      since it is mainly just being used by some close friends of mine, I will keep it as a \
      simple bash script for now." }
