        <p> My core responsibilities as my role as Service Desk Lead, were to provide level 1 support for tickets
            that came through our ticketing system, as well as to document, setup and deploy equiptment across the 
            council. Laptop setups required setting up VPN's, Connecting users to a VOIP system, Imaging the Systems via
            SCCM, as well as working with the users to get role specific apps working as intended. </p>

      <h4 class="break" style="padding-top=20px;"> Contracted to Otago Regional Council   </h4>
      
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      <h4 class="pushLeft"><i> User Support Engineer </i> </h4> <h4 class="pushRight">February 1 2020 - February 12 2020</h4>
    <div style="clear: both;"></div>

      <br>
    
        <p> After one of the onsite NTT engineers took time off, I was asked to be subcontracted from DTSL to assist NTT for their onsite 
          service desk in the mornings during his absence. In this role, I was able to help with level 2 tickets, both diagnosing problems and finding solution to them.

          This role gave me more experience in being self managed as well as letting me broaden what sort of tickets I was able to do
