      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p> I have worked on several small projects, either to learn a language,
        or just as something to do! I have a few projects currently where I am a little
        stuck, and plenty of projects which I have finished. Some of these projects are
        just running small servers, whereas others are programming projects in different 
        languages, or projects designed to help me learn an operating system. </p>
