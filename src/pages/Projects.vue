      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p> I have worked on several small projects, either to learn a language,
        or just as something to do! I have a few projects currently where I am a little
        stuck, and plenty of projects which I have finished. Some of these projects are
        just running small servers, whereas others are programming projects in different 
        languages, or projects designed to help me learn an operating system. </p>

        <h3>Radio</h3>
        <p> A Project I am currently working on is to run a small internet radio station,
          which is something I toyed with a year or so ago (Mid 2019). I am currently
          refactoring the code, building a Vue js frontend and redoing the backend so that
          the audiochannels are encrypted on their way to the client. You can find 
          the link to the github repository <a href="https://github.com/lunarised/radio">here!</a>
          </p><p>You can also find a link to the old version of the radio 
            <a href="https://lunarised.com/oldRadio/">here</a></p>
